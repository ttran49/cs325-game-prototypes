            </ul>
         <li>AND ALSO YOU CAN CLICK ON THE PONY.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
    
<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Move and fire to find yourself some love!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
It has been a while since the pony feels loved. Find love!
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Left/Right arrow keys to move left or right
Left Mouse click to fire your love!
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Entertainment! If the player laughs because of the game style and theme, that's a yes.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Pony goes left and right using left and right arrow keys. Hold down left mouse to fire its loves. If it hits the hearts falling down, score went up. Goal is to rack up as much loves as you can!
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
To see how the player would interact and how the game is handles when there are way too much hearts.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The uniqueness of the game will set the game apart.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
There is a lonely pony in the world. He just wants to be loved but no one ever gives him the love that he wanted. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
If the game has a story (or you envision a story for the full game), summarize it in a paragraph. How will the dramatic tension interact with the gameplay tension?
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Those that is single but anyone can also feels the love.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Generally 3-5 minutes but it could take as long as it take for the pony to feel loved! 
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Don't let the heart touches the ground. It will spawn more.
</li>
